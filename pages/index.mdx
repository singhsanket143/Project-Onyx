## Introduction

This website from [Algocamp](https://courses.algocamp.io/learn) focuses on engineering interviews and is divided into four parts, covering all aspects of engineering interviews for SDE 1, SDE 2 and senior engineering roles. It focuses on pattern based learning with interactive articles and video tutorials.

The patterns covered on this website are designed to guide you through common problems encountered in software development engineering (SDE) interviews. These patterns are not one-size-fits-all solutions, but rather tools to help you recognize specific problems, understand the patterns that address them, and implement those solutions effectively. The goal is to raise awareness of these patterns, the problems they solve, and how they can be applied in an interview setting.
